# Face_Recognition
Video-based face recognition

# How it works
Firstly, run 'main_window.py'. Click the 'Save' button to introduce a new person's face, enter the name in the pop-up window, then the video will start automatically.
Make sure your face is clearly visible and stop the video. Then click 'extract' and 'train' buttons sequentially.
The face appears as defined when you press 'Start' again.
